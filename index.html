        Google LLC (/ˈɡuːɡəl/ ⓘ) is an American multinational technology company
        focusing on artificial intelligence,[9] online advertising, search
        engine technology, cloud computing, computer software, quantum
        computing, e-commerce, and consumer electronics. It has been referred to
        as "the most powerful company in the world"[10] and as one of the
        world's most valuable brands due to its market dominance, data
        collection, and technological advantages in the field of artificial
        intelligence.[11][12][13] Alongside Amazon, Apple Inc., Meta, and
        Microsoft, Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. is one of the five Big
        Tech companies. Google was founded on September 4, 1998, by American
        computer scientists Larry Page and Sergey Brin while they were PhD
        students at Stanford University in California. Together they own about
        14% of its publicly listed shares and control 56% of its stockholder
        voting power through super-voting stock. The company went public via an
        initial public offering (IPO) in 2004. In 2015, Google was reorganized
        as a wholly owned subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. Google is Alphabet's
        largest subsidiary and is a holding company for Alphabet's internet
        properties and interests. Sundar Pichai was appointed CEO of Google on
        October 24, 2015, replacing Larry Page, who became the CEO of Alphabet.
        On December 3, 2019, Pichai also became the CEO of Alphabet.[14]

        The company has since rapidly grown to offer a multitude of products and
        services beyond Google Search, many of which hold dominant market
        positions. These products address a wide range of use cases, including
        email (Gmail), navigation (Waze & Maps), cloud computing (Cloud), web
        browsing (Chrome), video sharing (YouTube), productivity (Workspace),
        operating systems (Android), cloud storage (Drive), language translation
        (Translate), photo storage (Photos), video calling (Meet), smart home
        (Nest), smartphones (Pixel), wearable technology (Pixel Watch & Fitbit),
        music streaming (YouTube Music), video on demand (YouTube TV),
        artificial intelligence (Google Assistant & Bard), machine learning APIs
        (TensorFlow), AI chips (TPU), and more. Discontinued Google products
        include gaming (Stadia), Glass, Google+, Reader, Play Music, Nexus,
        Hangouts, and Inbox by Gmail.[15][16] Google's other ventures outside of
        Internet services and consumer electronics include quantum computing
        (Sycamore), self-driving cars (Waymo, formerly the Google Self-Driving
        Car Project), smart cities (Sidewalk Labs), and transformer models
        (Google Deepmind).[17] Google and YouTube are the two most visited
        websites worldwide followed by Facebook and X (formerly known as
        Twitter). Google is also the largest search engine, mapping and
        navigation application, email provider, office suite, video sharing
        platform, photo and cloud storage provider, mobile operating system, web
        browser, ML framework, and AI virtual assistant provider in the world as
        measured by market share. On the list of most valuable brands, Google is
        ranked second by Forbes[18] and fourth by Interbrand.[19] It has
        received significant criticism involving issues such as privacy
        concerns, tax avoidance, censorship, search neutrality, antitrust and
        abuse of its monopoly position.

    <h2>History</h2>
    <div id="hhh">
      <h3>
        Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2003 Google began in January 1996 as a
        research project by Larry Page and Sergey Brin when they were both PhD
        students at Stanford University in California.[20][21][22] The project
        initially involved an unofficial "third founder", Scott Hassan, the
        original lead programmer who wrote much of the code for the original
        Google Search engine, but he left before Google was officially founded
        as a company;[23][24] Hassan went on to pursue a career in robotics and
        founded the company Willow Garage in 2006.[25][26] While conventional
        search engines ranked results by counting how many times the search
        terms appeared on the page, they theorized about a better system that
        analyzed the relationships among websites.[27] They called this
        algorithm PageRank; it determined a website's relevance by the number of
        pages, and the importance of those pages that linked back to the
        original site.[28][29] Page told his ideas to Hassan, who began writing
        the code to implement Page's ideas.[23]
      </h3>
    </div>

    <div id="bgbg">
      <h3>
        Page and Brin originally nicknamed the new search engine "BackRub",
        because the system checked backlinks to estimate the importance of a
        site.[20][30][31] Hassan as well as Alan Steremberg were cited by Page
        and Brin as being critical to the development of Google. Rajeev Motwani
        and Terry Winograd later co-authored with Page and Brin the first paper
        about the project, describing PageRank and the initial prototype of the
        Google search engine, published in 1998. Héctor García-Molina and Jeff
        Ullman were also cited as contributors to the project.[32] PageRank was
        influenced by a similar page-ranking and site-scoring algorithm earlier
        used for RankDex, developed by Robin Li in 1996, with Larry Page's
        PageRank patent including a citation to Li's earlier RankDex patent; Li
        later went on to create the Chinese search engine Baidu.[33][34]
        Eventually, they changed the name to Google; the name of the search
        engine was a misspelling of the word googol,[20][35][36] a very large
        number written 10100 (1 followed by 100 zeros), picked to signify that
        the search engine was intended to provide large quantities of
        information.[37] Google's homepage in 1998 Google's original homepage
        had a simple design because the company founders had little experience
        in HTML, the markup language used for designing web pages.[38] Google
        was initially funded by an August 1998 investment of $100,000 from Andy
        Bechtolsheim,[20] co-founder of Sun Microsystems. This initial
        investment served as a motivation to incorporate the company to be able
        to use the funds.[39][40] Page and Brin initially approached David
        Cheriton for advice because he had a nearby office in Stanford, and they
        knew he had startup experience, having recently sold the company he
        co-founded, Granite Systems, to Cisco for $220 million. David arranged a
        meeting with Page and Brin and his Granite co-founder Andy Bechtolsheim.
        The meeting was set for 8 a.m. at the front porch of David's home in
        Palo Alto and it had to be brief because Andy had another meeting at
        Cisco, where he now worked after the acquisition, at 9 a.m. Andy briefly
        tested a demo of the website, liked what he saw, and then went back to
        his car to grab the check. David Cheriton later also joined in with a
        $250,000 investment.[41][42]
